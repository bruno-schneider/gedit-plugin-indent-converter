# Indent Converter plugin for Gedit

Converts tabs to spaces and spaces to tabs

Adds two items to **Edit** menu:

 - **Convert spaces to tabs** - replaces all leading spaces with tabs in current document. It uses smart guess algorithm to guess the tab size used in the document. If that fails - uses tab size from gedit preferences.

 - **Convert tabs to spaces** - replaces all leading tabs with spaces (size is taken from current gedit preferences) in current document.
